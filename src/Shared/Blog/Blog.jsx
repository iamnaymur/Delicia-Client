        1. Tell us the differences between uncontrolled and controlled
        components.
      </h1>{" "}
      <p className="text-xl">
        - A controlled component is controlled by the React states ,whereas the
        uncontrolled components maintains and controls all the things by its own
        internal state and not dependent on react. However there are some
        significant differences between this two. The data flow system in the
        controlled component flows from parent to components . Uncontrolled
        component flows the data among itself. Debugging is really an important
        thing for a developer and when it comes to uncontrolled components ,the
        debugging gets so tough and difficult. On the other hand debugging is
        way more easier in the controlled components, cause it is controlled
        automatically by the react. The code complexity is also much difficult
        on the uncontrolled components.

        2. How to validate React props using PropTypes.
      </h1>{" "}
      <p className="text-xl">
        - React is a javascript library used for creating interactive web
        frontend applications. We know that, parent components can pass any data
        as props to its children components. So If we can validate the data type
        of the prop before sending it to the child components ,it would get much
        easier to use and also ensures that the child gets what it expects.
        Therefor, the package called PropTypes is so much useful and this is
        also provided by the react. Once you have imported PropTypes, you can
        add it to your component by defining a static property called
        "propTypes".

        3. Tell us the difference between nodejs and express js.
      </h1>{" "}
      <p className="text-xl">
        - Node JS is a large open-source server-side runtime environment that is
        built on JavaScript. Whereas, the Express.js is a Node.js framework for
        web applications. So we can say that, the node.js is the parent of
        Express.js or Express.js is built on top of Node.js. Express.js
        simplifies the development process and provides a solid foundation for
        building web applications quickly. You can use Express.js to build web
        applications using Node.js, but Node.js can also be used independently
        without any framework.

        4. What is a custom hook, and why will you create a custom hook?
      </h1>{" "}
      <p className="text-xl">
        - A custom hook is a function that starts following the conventional
        naming system for a hook. A custom hook is reusable and it can be used
        depending on the situation handling. The main use case for a custom hook
        is to share stateful logic amongst the components available in the web
        application. If someone wants to fetch data from an API with a
        component, he can create a custom hook that can handle the API call,
        data fetching and so on. Custom hooks helps a lot to reduce the
        duplication of the same codes, which is an important part for a
        developer.
